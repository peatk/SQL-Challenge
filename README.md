### Background 
Acting as a Data Engineer I developed SQL queries to research and analyze employee data from six CSV files. The project is broken into 3 parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

#### Data Modeling

I developed an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for the project

#### Data Engineering

I ensured that all essential columns are defined for each table and are assigned the appropriate data types. I set primary keys for each table and establishing accurate references between related tables contribute to a well-structured database. The integration of foreign keys is crucial for establishing correct relationshipes between tables. I applied the NOT NULL condition to necessary columns to ensure data integrity. Additionally, defining value lengths for columns adds another layer of accuracy, collectively forming the foundation of effective data management.

#### Data Analysis
I developed 8 queries to analyze the data for this project


##### _Employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee_
